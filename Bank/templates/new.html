           A bank is a cornerstone of the modern financial system, serving as a pivotal institution that provides a wide array of financial services to individuals, businesses, and governments. At its core, a bank is a financial intermediary, connecting those with surplus funds to those in need of capital. One of its primary functions is to accept and safeguard deposits, offering various types of accounts to cater to diverse financial needs. This secure storage of funds allows individuals and entities to transact and manage their money efficiently.

    In addition to deposit services, banks are vital in extending credit and loans, thereby fueling economic growth and development.
